      description: "Experts estimate that as many as 98,000 people die in any given year from medical errors that occur in hospitals. That's more than die from motor vehicle accidents, breast cancer, or AIDS--three causes that receive far more public attention. Indeed, more people die annually from medication errors than from workplace injuries. Add the financial cost to the human tragedy, and medical error easily rises to the top ranks of urgent, widespread public problems. To Err Is Human breaks the silence that has surrounded medical errors and their consequence--but not by pointing fingers at caring health care professionals who make honest mistakes. After all, to err is human. Instead, this book sets forth a national agenda--with state and local implications--for reducing medical errors and improving patient safety through the design of a safer health system. This volume reveals the often startling statistics of medical error and the disparity between the incidence of error and public perception of it, given many patients' expectations that the medical profession always performs perfectly. A careful examination is made of how the surrounding forces of legislation, regulation, and market activity influence the quality of care provided by health care organizations and then looks at their handling of medical mistakes. Using a detailed case study, the book reviews the current understanding of why these mistakes happen. A key theme is that legitimate liability concerns discourage reporting of errors--which begs the question, \"How can we learn from our mistakes?\" Balancing regulatory versus market-based initiatives and public versus private efforts, the Institute of Medicine presents wide-ranging recommendations for improving patient safety, in the areas of leadership, improved data collection and analysis, and development of effective systems at the level of direct patient care. To Err Is Human asserts that the problem is not bad people in health care--it is that good people are working in bad systems that need to be made safer. Comprehensive and straightforward, this book offers a clear prescription for raising the level of patient safety in American health care. It also explains how patients themselves can influence the quality of care that they receive once they check into the hospital. This book will be vitally important to federal, state, and local health policy makers and regulators, health professional licensing officials, hospital administrators, medical educators and students, health caregivers, health journalists, patient advocates--as well as patients themselves. First in a series of publications from the Quality of Health Care in America, a project initiated by the Institute of Medicine",

      description: "In the depths of night, customs officers board a galley in a harbor and overpower its guards. In the hold they find oil and silver, and a naked boy chained to the bulkhead. Stunningly beautiful but half-starved, the boy has no name. The officers break the boy's chains to rescue him, but he escapes. Venice is at the height of its power. Duke Marco commands the seas, taxes his colonies, and, like every duke before him, fears assassins better than his own. In a side chapel, Marco's thirteen-year old cousin prays for deliverance from her forced marriage. It is her bad fortune to be there when Moorish pirates break in to steal a chalice, but it is the Moors' good fortune - they kidnap her and demand ransom from the Duke. As day dawns, Atilo, the Duke's chief assassin, prepares to kill the man who let in the pirates. Having cut the traitor's throat, he turns back, having heard a noise, and finds a stranger crouched over the dying man, drinking blood from the wound. The speed with which the boy dodges a dagger and scales a pillar stuns Atilo. And the assassin knows he has to find the boy. Not to kill him though - because he's finally found what he thought he would never find. Someone fit to be his apprentice.",

      description: "In this instant New York Times bestseller, Angela Duckworth shows anyone striving to succeed that the secret to outstanding achievement is not talent, but a special blend of passion and persistence she calls �grit.� �Inspiration for non-geniuses everywhere� (People). The daughter of a scientist who frequently noted her lack of �genius,� Angela Duckworth is now a celebrated researcher and professor. It was her early eye-opening stints in teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience that led to her hypothesis about what really drives success: not genius, but a unique combination of passion and long-term perseverance. In Grit, she takes us into the field to visit cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, teachers working in some of the toughest schools, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she�s learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers�from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll. �Duckworth�s ideas about the cultivation of tenacity have clearly changed some lives for the better� (The New York Times Book Review). Among Grit�s most valuable insights: any effort you make ultimately counts twice toward your goal; grit can be learned, regardless of IQ or circumstances; when it comes to child-rearing, neither a warm embrace nor high standards will work by themselves; how to trigger lifelong interest; the magic of the Hard Thing Rule; and so much more. Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, Grit is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how that�not talent or luck�makes all the difference.

In the standard story, the suffrage crusade began in Seneca Falls in 1848 and ended with the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920. But this overwhelmingly white women's movement did not win the vote for most black women. Securing their rights required a movement of their own. In Vanguard, acclaimed historian Martha S. Jones offers a new history of African American women's political lives in America. She recounts how they defied both racism and sexism to fight for the ballot, and how they wielded political power to secure the equality and dignity of all persons. From the earliest days of the republic to the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and beyond, Jones excavates the lives and work of black women -- Maria Stewart, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Fannie Lou Hamer, and more -- who were the vanguard of women's rights, calling on America to realize its best ideals.",

      description: "A riveting, deeply personal account of history in the making�from the president who inspired us to believe in the power of democracy #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER � NAACP IMAGE AWARD NOMINEE � NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The Washington Post � Jennifer Szalai, The New York Times � NPR � The Guardian � Marie Claire In the stirring, highly anticipated first volume of his presidential memoirs, Barack Obama tells the story of his improbable odyssey from young man searching for his identity to leader of the free world, describing in strikingly personal detail both his political education and the landmark moments of the first term of his historic presidency�a time of dramatic transformation and turmoil. Obama takes readers on a compelling journey from his earliest political aspirations to the pivotal Iowa caucus victory that demonstrated the power of grassroots activism to the watershed night of November 4, 2008, when he was elected 44th president of the United States, becoming the first African American to hold the nation�s highest office. Reflecting on the presidency, he offers a unique and thoughtful exploration of both the awesome reach and the limits of presidential power, as well as singular insights into the dynamics of U.S. partisan politics and international diplomacy. Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune�s Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden. A Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspective�the story of one man�s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of �hope and change,� and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible. This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama�s conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day.",

But in today�s dramatically reconfigured world, success is increasingly dependent on how we interact with others. In Give and Take, Adam Grant, an award-winning researcher and Wharton�s highest-rated professor, examines the surprising forces that shape why some people rise to the top of the success ladder while others sink to the bottom. Praised by social scientists, business theorists, and corporate leaders, Give and Take opens up an approach to work, interactions, and productivity that is nothing short of revolutionary.",

Offering a unique and noteworthy take on death, this book balances the somber topic with a dog's ever-optimistic viewpoint, all woven together with its unconventional yet fitting approach to language. Family members, librarians, art-lovers, and educators alike will use this book as an accessible and comforting introduction to the ever-difficult topic of death, discussed and related in a new way with hopeful, uplifting, innovative language. THE PERFECT BOOK TO TALK ABOUT LOSS: The perennial themes of grief, fear, and death are always relevant and classic discussion topics even in families not yet dealing with death. The perfect answer to kids' big questions about what happens when we die, this book will be a standard in every home library. CREATIVE USE OF LANGUAGE: The words in this book are incredibly special, with phrases that conjure how the dog sees the world. The enjoyable challenge of matching up \"letsgoboy\" to a walk or \"pufftails\" to rabbits will make for meaningful discussions on a parent's lap or in a classroom reading circle. TEACHES CHILDREN EMPATHY: Reading this story from the dog's perspective is the perfect way for young readers to understand that the way another character thinks and perceives the world is different from their own experience. A BEAUTIFUL DOG STORY: Ideal for readers who love dogs, want dogs, or are going through a grieving process for their family dog, this book celebrates all that is most magical about these animals who are always by our side. A COMFORTING MESSAGE: It's rare for a book about death to extend beyond the moment of dying. The continuation of the dog's story past this point makes it special and especially comforting. Perfect for: parents and caregivers, dog lovers, educators",

Time is up for our friends the AstroNuts. In fact, time is up for you, too. If they don't succeed on this mission, Earth is doomed! So when the team finds out they're being sent to a place called \"the perfect planet,\" their mission sounds way too easy. Unfortunately, the second they land, they realize they'll be dealing with the most dangerous species of all time . . . humans. Huh? Where in the universe is this supposedly perfect place? And how will the Nuts manage to convince the humans to risk death . . . for the sake of their lives?! Featuring full-color illustrations throughout, Planet Earth as the narrator, an out-of-this-world gatefold, and how-to-draw pages in the back, eager and reluctant readers alike will be over the moon about this new mission.

She has dedicated her work to exploring issues of personal and collective identity through photographs of female adolescence and womanhood--both in the United States where she lives, and in the Middle East where she is from. Rania Matar: She focuses on young women in their late teens and early twenties, who are leaving the cocoon of home, entering adulthood and facing a new reality. Depicting women in the United States and the Middle East, this project highlights how female subjectivity develops in parallel forms across cultural lines. Each young woman becomes an active participant in the image-making process, presiding over the environment and making it her own. Matar portrays the raw beauty of her subjects--their age, individuality, physicality and mystery--and photographs them the way she, a woman and a mother, sees them: beautiful, alive.",

Society trusts that the results of research reflect an honest attempt by scientists to describe the world accurately and without bias. But this trust will endure only if the scientific community devotes itself to exemplifying and transmitting the values associated with ethical scientific conduct. On Being a Scientist was designed to supplement the informal lessons in ethics provided by research supervisors and mentors. The book describes the ethical foundations of scientific practices and some of the personal and professional issues that researchers encounter in their work. It applies to all forms of research-whether in academic, industrial, or governmental settings-and to all scientific disciplines. This third edition of On Being a Scientist reflects developments since the publication of the original edition in 1989 and a second edition in 1995. A continuing feature of this edition is the inclusion of a number of hypothetical scenarios offering guidance in thinking about and discussing these scenarios. On Being a Scientist is aimed primarily at graduate students and beginning researchers, but its lessons apply to all scientists at all stages of their scientific careers.",

      description: "On Alexis Rockman's darkly surreal vision of the collisions between civilization and nature With a career spanning over three decades, internationally acclaimed American artist Alexis Rockman is well known for his complex, large-scale paintings and works on paper depicting the collision between civilization and nature. Rockman synthesizes elements of human history, natural science, landscape painting, art history and science fiction with passionate interest in climate change and globalization, to create images that reveal our world balancing on the precipice. Alexis Rockman: Works on Paperis the first comprehensive survey of the artist's graphic work, documenting his extraordinary accomplishments as a draftsman through a meticulous selection of watercolors, gouaches, oil drawings and field studies. Designed by Tony Morgan in close collaboration with the artist, the book reproduces over 150 works, many of which have never before been published. Included here are his earliest watercolors from the 1980s, often of hybrid and mutated animals; the Field Drawings, created in Guyana and other locations from mud sourced on-site; the ominously beautiful and apocalyptic Weather Drawings; painterly works relating to his epic The Great Lakes Cycle; Wallace's Line, a visual investigation of the life of scientist and explorer Alfred Russel Wallace; and Lost at Sea, his most recent body of work focused on shipwrecks. The book includes newly commissioned essays by Helen Molesworth and David Rimanelli. In addition, it includes a visual appendix of Rockman's graphic influences, with commentary by the artist. Born in 1962 in New York, where he lives and works, Alexis Rockmanhas had solo museum exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum, the Wexner Center for the Arts (both 2004), the Rhode Island School of Design (2005), the Smithsonian American Art Museum (2010), the Drawing Center (2013) and the Grand Rapids Art Museum (2018).",

      description: "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER � An award-winning guide to the sometimes erratic and confusing behavior of teenage girls that explains what�s going on, prepares parents for what�s to come, and lets them know when it�s time to worry. Look for Under Pressure, the companion guide to coping with stress and anxiety among girls, available now. In this sane, highly engaging, and informed guide for parents of daughters, Dr. Damour draws on decades of experience and the latest research to reveal the seven distinct�and absolutely normal�developmental transitions that turn girls into grown-ups, including Parting with Childhood, Contending with Adult Authority, Entering the Romantic World, and Caring for Herself. Providing realistic scenarios and welcome advice on how to engage daughters in smart, constructive ways, Untangled gives parents a broad framework for understanding their daughters while addressing their most common questions, including � My thirteen-year-old rolls her eyes when I try to talk to her, and only does it more when I get angry with her about it. How should I respond? � Do I tell my teen daughter that I�m checking her phone? � My daughter suffers from test anxiety. What can I do to help her? � Where�s the line between healthy eating and having an eating disorder? � My teenage daughter wants to know why I�m against pot when it�s legal in some states. What should I say? � My daughter�s friend is cutting herself. Do I call the girl�s mother to let her know? Perhaps most important, Untangled helps mothers and fathers understand, connect, and grow with their daughters. When parents know what makes their daughter tick, they can embrace and enjoy the challenge of raising a healthy, happy young woman. BOOKS FOR A BETTER LIFE AWARD WINNER �Finally, there�s some good news for puzzled parents of adolescent girls, and psychologist Lisa Damour is the bearer of that happy news. [Untangled] is the most down-to-earth, readable parenting book I�ve come across in a long time.��The Washington Post �Anna Freud wrote in 1958, �There are few situations in life which are more difficult to cope with than an adolescent son or daughter during the attempt to liberate themselves.� In the intervening decades, the transition doesn�t appear to have gotten any easier which makes Untangled such a welcome new resource.��The Boston Globe",

In this story, an expanded version of Collodi's original tale, we see him lose his tail to an ancient crocodile, end up as a valet to a young master, fall into the hands of flying bandits and become emperor of a tribe of apes, before preparing to set off on a long journey at sea. Collodi wrote this story immediately after Pinocchio, and the little monkey's adventures present clear similarities, both in terms of themes and characters, with his more celebrated masterpiece.

All About Love reveals what causes a polarized society, and how to heal the divisions that cause suffering. Here is the truth about love, and inspiration to help us instill caring, compassion, and strength in our homes, schools, and workplaces. �The word �love� is most often defined as a noun, yet we would all love better if we used it as a verb,� writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love. Here, at her most provocative and intensely personal, renowned scholar, cultural critic and feminist bell hooks offers a proactive new ethic for a society bereft with lovelessness--not the lack of romance, but the lack of care, compassion, and unity. People are divided, she declares, by society�s failure to provide a model for learning to love. As bell hooks uses her incisive mind to explore the question �What is love?� her answers strike at both the mind and heart. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the �100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.� All About Love is a powerful, timely affirmation of just how profoundly her revelations can change hearts and minds for the better.",

      description: "A bright spring day was fading into evening. High overhead in the clear heavens small rosy clouds seemed hardly to move across the sky but to be sinking into its depths of blue. In a handsome house in one of the outlying streets of the government town of O (it was in the year 1842) two women were sitting at an open window; one was about fifty, the other an old lady of seventy. The name of the former was Marya Dmitrievna Kalitin. Her husband, a shrewd determined man of obstinate bilious temperament, had been dead for ten years. He had been a provincial public prosecutor, noted in his own day as a successful man of business. He had received a fair education and had been to the university; but having been born in narrow circumstances he realized early in life the necessity of pushing his own way in the world and making money. It had been a love-match on Marya Dmitrievna's side. He was not bad-looking, was clever and could be very agreeable when he chose. Marya Dmitrievna Pesto that was her maiden name had lost her parents in childhood. She spent some years in a boarding-school in Moscow, and after leaving school, lived on the family estate of Pokrovskoe, about forty miles from O , with her aunt and her elder brother. This brother soon after obtained a post in Petersburg, and made them a scanty allowance. He treated his aunt and sister very shabbily till his sudden death cut short his career. Marya Dmitrievna inherited Pokrovskoe, but she did not live there long. Two years after her marriage with Kalitin, who succeeded in winning her heart in a few days, Pokrovskoe was exchanged for another estate, which yielded a much larger income, but was utterly unattractive and had no house. At the same time Kalitin took a house in the town of O , in which he and his wife took up their permanent abode. There was a large garden round the house, which on one side looked out upon the open country away from the town.",

      description: "Portraits of American and Middle Eastern young women entering adulthood from Rania Matar, author of L'Enfant-Femme As a Lebanese-born American artist and mother, Rania Matar's (born 1964) cross-cultural experiences inform her art. She has dedicated her work to exploring issues of personal and collective identity through photographs of female adolescence and womanhood--both in the United States where she lives, and in the Middle East where she is from. Rania Matar: She focuses on young women in their late teens and early twenties, who are leaving the cocoon of home, entering adulthood and facing a new reality. Depicting women in the United States and the Middle East, this project highlights how female subjectivity develops in parallel forms across cultural lines. Each young woman becomes an active participant in the image-making process, presiding over the environment and making it her own. Matar portrays the raw beauty of her subjects--their age, individuality, physicality and mystery--and photographs them the way she, a woman and a mother, sees them: beautiful, alive.",

      description: "The scientific research enterprise is built on a foundation of trust. Scientists trust that the results reported by others are valid. Society trusts that the results of research reflect an honest attempt by scientists to describe the world accurately and without bias. But this trust will endure only if the scientific community devotes itself to exemplifying and transmitting the values associated with ethical scientific conduct. On Being a Scientist was designed to supplement the informal lessons in ethics provided by research supervisors and mentors. The book describes the ethical foundations of scientific practices and some of the personal and professional issues that researchers encounter in their work. It applies to all forms of research-whether in academic, industrial, or governmental settings-and to all scientific disciplines. This third edition of On Being a Scientist reflects developments since the publication of the original edition in 1989 and a second edition in 1995. A continuing feature of this edition is the inclusion of a number of hypothetical scenarios offering guidance in thinking about and discussing these scenarios. On Being a Scientist is aimed primarily at graduate students and beginning researchers, but its lessons apply to all scientists at all stages of their scientific careers.",

      description: "On Alexis Rockman's darkly surreal vision of the collisions between civilization and nature With a career spanning over three decades, internationally acclaimed American artist Alexis Rockman is well known for his complex, large-scale paintings and works on paper depicting the collision between civilization and nature. Rockman synthesizes elements of human history, natural science, landscape painting, art history and science fiction with passionate interest in climate change and globalization, to create images that reveal our world balancing on the precipice. Alexis Rockman: Works on Paperis the first comprehensive survey of the artist's graphic work, documenting his extraordinary accomplishments as a draftsman through a meticulous selection of watercolors, gouaches, oil drawings and field studies. Designed by Tony Morgan in close collaboration with the artist, the book reproduces over 150 works, many of which have never before been published. Included here are his earliest watercolors from the 1980s, often of hybrid and mutated animals; the Field Drawings, created in Guyana and other locations from mud sourced on-site; the ominously beautiful and apocalyptic Weather Drawings; painterly works relating to his epic The Great Lakes Cycle; Wallace's Line, a visual investigation of the life of scientist and explorer Alfred Russel Wallace; and Lost at Sea, his most recent body of work focused on shipwrecks. The book includes newly commissioned essays by Helen Molesworth and David Rimanelli. In addition, it includes a visual appendix of Rockman's graphic influences, with commentary by the artist. Born in 1962 in New York, where he lives and works, Alexis Rockmanhas had solo museum exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum, the Wexner Center for the Arts (both 2004), the Rhode Island School of Design (2005), the Smithsonian American Art Museum (2010), the Drawing Center (2013) and the Grand Rapids Art Museum (2018).",

Compiled by Free Minds Book Club & Writing Workshop, this rich collection includes firsthand accounts from both the young people charged and incarcerated in the adult criminal legal system and from the community at large: the mothers, the loved ones, the correctional staff, public defenders, prosecutors, and others harmed and left with unhealed trauma. These critical voices, uniquely combined, illustrate the ecosystem that surrounds youth who are incarcerated--and expose the ripple effects that touch us all. This book challenges us to hear these voices calling out for accountability, transformative justice, and healing. Together, they demonstrate the collective impact of the prison system, and our collective responsibility to create a society where every one of us can thrive.",

Using an innovative application of industrial epoxies, plastics and resins, Pashgian's works are characterized by their translucent surfaces that appear to filter and somehow contain illumination. \"One must move around to observe changes,\" she testifies: \"coming and going, appearing and receding, visible and invisible--a phenomenon of constant movement.\" This book documents Pashgian's vast body of work, dating from the 1960s to now, with historic and new photographs of the artist's spheres and discs. An essay by John Yau and a chronology built on new research is also included.",

      description: "'The best business book I've ever read.' Bill Gates, Wall Street Journal 'The Michael Lewis of his day.' New York Times What do the $350 million Ford Motor Company disaster known as the Edsel, the fast and incredible rise of Xerox, and the unbelievable scandals at General Electric and Texas Gulf Sulphur have in common? Each is an example of how an iconic company was defined by a particular moment of fame or notoriety. These notable and fascinating accounts are as relevant today to understanding the intricacies of corporate life as they were when the events happened. Stories about Wall Street are infused with drama and adventure and reveal the machinations and volatile nature of the world of finance. John Brooks's insightful reportage is so full of personality and critical detail that whether he is looking at the astounding market crash of 1962, the collapse of a well-known brokerage firm, or the bold attempt by American bankers to save the British pound, one gets the sense that history really does repeat itself. This business classic written by longtime New Yorker contributor John Brooks is an insightful and engaging look into corporate and financial life in America.",

      description: "Explores the passions and contradictions--both human and political--that turned the prolific and brilliant painter, Diego Rivera, into an increasingly universal cultural figure Diego Rivera was a revolutionary painter in more ways than one. Attending art school at 11, by his twenties he was counted among the most influential figures of the Parisian art scene of the early 20th century, including Picasso, Modigliani, Braque, and Gris. Rivera's murals, both in his native Mexico and the United States, reflect the contradictory turbulence of his character and times. He met Lenin in Paris, Stalin in Moscow, and offered refuge to Trotsky during his Mexican exile. Meanwhile, his work was commissioned by giants of capitalism: Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller. Rivera's indefatigable industry was matched by his zest for life, accumulating hundreds of lovers and four wives--including Frida Kahlo, whose formidable partnership is also one of the great love stories of art history. This beautifully realized graphic novel tells the story of the extraordinary life and times of an artist for whom myth and reality fused.",

While foreign affairs have become the central issues of her chancellorship in this crucial election year, the entire world is anxiously looking to Germany to play its part in Europe�s rescue. This authorized biography sheds light on the person behind the politician � from her youthful days of hitchhiking in Tbilisi to being the guest of honour at a White House state dinner � and examines how a girl from East Germany rose to the highest echelons of European power. As well as explaining how Angela Merkel�s world view was shaped and influenced by her background and ideology, Stefan Kornelius�s lively account discusses her personal relations with international counterparts such as David Cameron, Barack Obama or Vladimir Putin, as well as her attitude towards the countries and cultures over which they rule.",

      description: "The book we need NOW to avoid a social recession, Murthy�s prescient message is about the importance of human connection, the hidden impact of loneliness on our health, and the social power of community. Humans are social creatures: In this simple and obvious fact lies both the problem and the solution to the current crisis of loneliness. In his groundbreaking book, the 19th surgeon general of the United States Dr. Vivek Murthy makes a case for loneliness as a public health concern: a root cause and contributor to many of the epidemics sweeping the world today from alcohol and drug addiction to violence to depression and anxiety. Loneliness, he argues, is affecting not only our health, but also how our children experience school, how we perform in the workplace, and the sense of division and polarization in our society. But, at the center of our loneliness is our innate desire to connect. We have evolved to participate in community, to forge lasting bonds with others, to help one another, and to share life experiences. We are, simply, better together. The lessons in Together have immediate relevance and application. These four key strategies will help us not only to weather this crisis, but also to heal our social world far into the future. Spend time each day with those you love. Devote at least 15 minutes each day to connecting with those you most care about. Focus on each other. Forget about multitasking and give the other person the gift of your full attention, making eye contact, if possible, and genuinely listening. Embrace solitude. The first step toward building stronger connections with others is to build a stronger connection with oneself. Meditation, prayer, art, music, and time spent outdoors can all be sources of solitary comfort and joy. Help and be helped. Service is a form of human connection that reminds us of our value and purpose in life. Checking on a neighbor, seeking advice, even just offering a smile to a stranger six feet away, all can make us stronger. During Murthy�s tenure as Surgeon General and during the research for Together, he found that there were few issues that elicited as much enthusiastic interest from both very conservative and very liberal members of Congress, from young and old people, or from urban and rural residents alike. Loneliness was something so many people have known themselves or have seen in the people around them. In the book, Murthy also shares his own deeply personal experiences with the subject--from struggling with loneliness in school, to the devastating loss of his uncle who succumbed to his own loneliness, as well as the important example of community and connection that his parents modeled. Simply, it�s a universal condition that affects all of us directly or through the people we love�now more than ever.",

NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY Chicago Tribune � The New York Public Library � Publishers Weekly AND ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The New York Times Book Review � Time � BuzzFeed � Esquire � Library Journal � Kirkus Reviews �How brown is too brown?� �Can Indians be racist?� �What does real love between really different people look like?� Like many six-year-olds, Mira Jacob�s half-Jewish, half-Indian son, Z, has questions about everything. At first they are innocuous enough, but as tensions from the 2016 election spread from the media into his own family, they become much, much more complicated. Trying to answer him honestly, Mira has to think back to where she�s gotten her own answers: her most formative conversations about race, color, sexuality, and, of course, love. Written with humor and vulnerability, this deeply relatable graphic memoir is a love letter to the art of conversation�and to the hope that hovers in our most difficult questions. LONGLISTED FOR THE PEN/OPEN BOOK AWARD �Jacob�s earnest recollections are often heartbreaking, but also infused with levity and humor. What stands out most is the fierce compassion with which she parses the complexities of family and love.��Time �Good Talk uses a masterful mix of pictures and words to speak on life�s most uncomfortable conversations.��io9 �Mira Jacob just made me toss everything I thought was possible in a book-as-art-object into the garbage.

Riveting, disturbing, and rendered in masterful detail.��Leigh Bardugo In his adult novel debut, Hugo, Nebula, Locus, and NAACP Image Award finalist and ALA Alex and New England Book Award winner Tochi Onyebuchi delivers a sweeping science fiction epic in the vein of Samuel R. Delany and Station Eleven In the 2050s, Earth has begun to empty. Those with the means and the privilege have departed the great cities of the United States for the more comfortable confines of space colonies. Those left behind salvage what they can from the collapsing infrastructure. As they eke out an existence, their neighborhoods are being cannibalized. Brick by brick, their houses are sent to the colonies, what was once a home now a quaint reminder for the colonists of the world that they wrecked. A primal biblical epic flung into the future, Goliath weaves together disparate narratives�a space-dweller looking at New Haven, Connecticut as a chance to reconnect with his spiraling lover; a group of laborers attempting to renew the promises of Earth�s crumbling cities; a journalist attempting to capture the violence of the streets; a marshal trying to solve a kidnapping�into a richly urgent mosaic about race, class, gentrification, and who is allowed to be the hero of any history.

Using an innovative application of industrial epoxies, plastics and resins, Pashgian's works are characterized by their translucent surfaces that appear to filter and somehow contain illumination. \"One must move around to observe changes,\" she testifies: \"coming and going, appearing and receding, visible and invisible--a phenomenon of constant movement.\" This book documents Pashgian's vast body of work, dating from the 1960s to now, with historic and new photographs of the artist's spheres and discs.

New York Times What do the $350 million Ford Motor Company disaster known as the Edsel, the fast and incredible rise of Xerox, and the unbelievable scandals at General Electric and Texas Gulf Sulphur have in common? Each is an example of how an iconic company was defined by a particular moment of fame or notoriety. These notable and fascinating accounts are as relevant today to understanding the intricacies of corporate life as they were when the events happened. Stories about Wall Street are infused with drama and adventure and reveal the machinations and volatile nature of the world of finance. John Brooks's insightful reportage is so full of personality and critical detail that whether he is looking at the astounding market crash of 1962, the collapse of a well-known brokerage firm, or the bold attempt by American bankers to save the British pound, one gets the sense that history really does repeat itself. This business classic written by longtime New Yorker contributor John Brooks is an insightful and engaging look into corporate and financial life in America.",

Attending art school at 11, by his twenties he was counted among the most influential figures of the Parisian art scene of the early 20th century, including Picasso, Modigliani, Braque, and Gris. Rivera's murals, both in his native Mexico and the United States, reflect the contradictory turbulence of his character and times. He met Lenin in Paris, Stalin in Moscow, and offered refuge to Trotsky during his Mexican exile. Meanwhile, his work was commissioned by giants of capitalism: Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller. Rivera's indefatigable industry was matched by his zest for life, accumulating hundreds of lovers and four wives--including Frida Kahlo, whose formidable partnership is also one of the great love stories of art history. This beautifully realized graphic novel tells the story of the extraordinary life and times of an artist for whom myth and reality fused.",

      description: "A NATIONAL JEWISH BOOK AWARD FINALIST A Recommended Book From: The New York Times * Good Morning America * Entertainment Weekly * Electric Literature * The New York Post * Alma * The Millions * Book Riot A commanding debut and a poignant coming-of-age story about a devout Jewish high school student whose plunge into the secularized world threatens everything he knows of himself Ari Eden�s life has always been governed by strict rules. In ultra-Orthodox Brooklyn, his days are dedicated to intense study and religious rituals, and adolescence feels profoundly lonely. So when his family announces that they are moving to a glitzy Miami suburb, Ari seizes his unexpected chance for reinvention. Enrolling in an opulent Jewish academy, Ari is stunned by his peers� dizzying wealth, ambition, and shameless pursuit of life�s pleasures. When the academy�s golden boy, Noah, takes Ari under his wing, Ari finds himself entangled in the school�s most exclusive and wayward group. These friends are magnetic and defiant�especially Evan, the brooding genius of the bunch, still living in the shadow of his mother�s death. Influenced by their charismatic rabbi, the group begins testing their religion in unconventional ways. Soon Ari and his friends are pushing moral boundaries and careening toward a perilous future�one in which the traditions of their faith are repurposed to mysterious, tragic ends. Mesmerizing and playful, heartrending and darkly romantic, The Orchard probes the conflicting forces that determine who we become: the heady relationships of youth, the allure of greatness, the doctrines we inherit, and our concealed desires.",

      description: "With mounting intensity extended across three sections of poems, Ben Estes' achingly personal second collection unfolds to reveal an uncertain past, present, and future that is by turns mysterious and beautiful. ABC MOONLIGHT contains poems that are filled with reflective awareness and subconsciously constructed dreams; a sweeping landscape of queer Midwestern loss and desire; and pairs of \"folded poems\" that question love, hope, and vulnerability in these harrowing times. Rather than prescribing answers, Estes offers the reader intimacy and open-handed, big-hearted consolation--\"Now to let something go / of myself, / without any need / to replace it\" \"Ben Estes' new poems, here gathered together into numbered, cadenced and syncopated movements, trace themselves onto the reader's consciousness like a sort of extended, scorched earth sigh: 'Humans will / lose their purpose,' it says. 'Phew.' Flood and fire focused, like the times they are written inside of, the poems' language drives straight towards, and eventually lands in, the telegraphic delivery of dreams, where loss and love are confused and finally remembered to be the same thing. The unexpectedness of fantasy mixed with the inevitability of memory is narrated by Estes from both before and after.\"--Matt Connors \"Val�ry says that the future is \"the most perceptible fraction of the present moment,\" but ABC MOONLIGHT gets us, as Devo says, jerkin' back'n' forth between what a mind once made up and the life to come. The writing here is a generous fusion of poetry and dreaming, one in which the poet-dreamer is ever cognizant of the collective as he plumbs his mind to find love and death in the American navel. If this book were a band, it would be called Ben Estes and Latent Destiny, and they'd play at your place every night.\"--Graham Foust \"This poetry is snaily, somehow: both within and looking upon. It suggests we have to hide, but also plod on. And that is just how things feel, so often now. Ben Estes's new poems give me the feeling of life, aliveness, what it's like. There's apocalypse in ABC Moonlight but also tender, gorgeous wondering about human futures, wonder in both the forward-looking action sense (I wonder what will happen) and wonder in whatever is left of the Romantic address�awe and amazement. The line is magic again. The moon is babble.\"--Hannah Brooks Motl Poetry. LGBTQIA Studies. California Interest.",

It was first published in 1990 to fulfill a long-felt need within the Fellowship for a collection of reflections that moves through the calendar year--one day at a time. Each page contains a reflection on a quotation from A.A. Conference-approved literature, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, As Bill Sees It and other books. These reflections were submitted by members of the A.A. Fellowship who were not professional writers, nor did they speak for A.A. but only for themselves, from their own experiences in sobriety. Thus the book offers sharing, day by day, from a broad cross section of members, which focuses on the Three Legacies of Alcoholics Anonymous: Recovery, Unity and Service. Daily Reflections has proved to be a popular book that aids individuals in their practice of daily meditation and provides inspiration to group discussions even as it presents an introduction for some to A.A. literature as a whole.",

Willa Reece has written a magical, romantic tale about our essential connections to nature and to each other.\" --Sarah Addison Allen, New York Times bestselling author At the age of eleven, Mel Smith's life found its purpose when she met Sarah Ross. Ten years later, Sarah's sudden death threatens to break her. To fulfill a final promise to her best friend, Mel travels to an idyllic small town nestled in the shadows of the Appalachian Mountains. Yet Morgan's Gap is more than a land of morning mists and deep forest shadows. There are secrets that call to Mel, in the gaze of the gnarled and knowing woman everyone calls Granny, in a salvaged remedy book filled with the magic of simple mountain traditions, and in the connection, she feels to the Ross homestead and the wilderness around it. With every taste of sweet honey and tart blackberries, the wildwood twines further into Mel's broken heart. But a threat lingers in the woods--one that may have something to do with Sarah's untimely death and that has now set its sight on Mel. The wildwood is whispering. It has secrets to reveal--if you're willing to listen . . . Praise for Wildwood Whispers: \"Willa Reece has perfectly infused magic, suspense, and a love of nature deep into the pages of this novel.

Bill Doherty blends decades clinical experience with deeply personal and philosophical experience and uses detailed case examples to form a roadmap for other psychotherapists to follow. He outlines a framework for addressing clients' moral quandaries: the LEAP-C model, which applies traditional therapeutic skills of listening, exploring, affirming, and offering perspective, as well as challenging clients to recognize ethical issues they don't perceive. Doherty addresses specific types of ethical dilemmas, such as keeping and ending commitments, having affairs, lying and deceiving, and causing psychological or physical harm to others. His guidelines incorporate a pluralistic view where therapists help clients balance their personal needs with their sense of responsibility for others. He also explores how psychologists and others can serve as citizen therapists who lend their expertise as consultants to help solve larger societal concerns, such as political polarization and police-community relations.",

As she followed the shows from town to town, she captured the dancers on stage and off, their public performances as well as their private lives, creating a portrait both documentary and empathetic: \"The recognition of this world is not the invention of it. I wanted to present an account of the girl show that portrayed what I saw and revealed how the people involved felt about what they were doing.\" Meiselas also taped candid interviews with the dancers, their boyfriends, the show managers and paying customers, which form a crucial part of the book. Meiselas' frank description of these women brought a hidden world to public attention, and explored the complex role the carnival played in their lives: mobility, money and liberation, but also undeniable objectification and exploitation. Produced during the early years of the women's movement, Carnival Strippers reflects the struggle for identity and self-esteem that characterized a complex era of change. Featuring largely unpublished additional photos, contact sheets, maps and letters, Carnival Strippers - Revisited gives new depth to Meiselas' influential vision. Born in Maryland in 1938, Susan Meiselas has worked as a freelance documentary photographer since joining Magnum Photos in 1976. Her images, particularly those covering the hostilities in Central America during the insurrection, have been widely published and exhibited. Meiselas' many books include Carnival Strippers (1976), Nicaragua (1981), Kurdistan: In the Shadow of History (1997), a project on the 100-year photographic history of Kurdistan, Pandora's Box (2001), exploring a New York S&M club, and Tar Beach (2020).",
